## Agile and Scrum Questions

**WHAT IS AGILE?**

- Agile is a methodology often applied to software development, with a focus on continuous delivery of incremental changes in small timeframes of a few weeks, rather than delivering a monumental change after a year.
- In general, the Agile manifesto favours interactions and collaborations between developers and customers, with a flexibility to change throughout the course of development.
- For example, as a result of the consideration of these principles, I have a weekly 121 meeting with my trainer in which we discuss ways for both of us to improve at our respective roles.
- This is drastically more beneficial than a quarterly performance review as I can work on smaller improvements each week instead of changing everything after a few months.

**WHAT IS SCRUM?**

- Scrum is a framework centered around continuous improvement, which also happens to be a core principle of agile.
- Work is completed in short timeframes also known as sprints, in which the team clearly lays out what has to be done, without necessarily having to worry about the big picture
- Scrum is structured to allow teams to adapt to changing conditions and user requirements 
- For example, we use an agile board throughout our training to keep a list of subjects we will eventually cover, with a sprint backlog containing more specific topics to complete for the week.
- This way we can focus all of our energy on what needs to be done in the week, without having to be concerned of what we'll do in a week or two

**WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AGILE AND SCRUM?**

- Agile is a methodology and mindset with principles and ideals, whereas Scrum is an actual framework for getting work done.
- There are many frameworks that could fit with the Agile methodology

**WHAT ARE THE 3 AMIGOS**

- The 3 Amigos is the grouping of 3 types of people:
    - Business analysts, who consider the product requirements
    - Developers, who consider the actual code to meet these requirements
    - Testers, who discuss test cases to ensure the reliability and quality of the code
- The 3 Amigos may have meetings from 30 to 60 minutes to discuss the aspects of a user story and ensure everyone is on the same page, each person understanding exactly what they have to do.

**WHAT ARE SCRUM ROLES, ARTIFACTS, AND CEREMONIES**

- There are 3 Scrum Roles within a team:
    - Product Owner, focused on understanding the business, customer, and market requirements and prioritising work accordingly
    - Development team, team of developers who build the actual code to meet the product requirements, and forecast how much work to complete with each sprint
    - Scrum Master, focused on ensuring optimising work flow for the team, and bridging the gap between the product owner and the development team

- There are 3 Scrum Artifacts used:
    - Product backlog, maintained by the Product Owner, contains an everchanging list of requirements, that may be re-prioritised as the market and demand for items may change
    - Sprint backlog, list of user stories or bug fixes that the development set out to complete in the current sprint cycle, these items are selected from the product backlog
    - Increment (sprint goal), refers to the usable end-product from a sprint, often referred to as the team's 'definition of done'

- There are 4 main Scrum ceremonies:
    - Sprint Planning, meeting at the beginning of each sprint to define the sprint goal
    - Daily stand up, short meeting every day to ensure everyone is on the same page, and voice any concerns or blockers that may have to be addressed before continuing
    - Sprint review, team showcases their increment at the end of the sprint to stakeholders for feedback
    - Sprint retrospective, where the team discuss what worked well and what needs to be improved for the next sprint.

## Elevator Pitch

- Hi my name is Leo Waltmann, I've recently completed a challenging degree in physics at Imperial College London.

- Although my primary experience was with python working on interesting data analysis and visualisation projects, I've had a variety of work experience from completing an internship at the Educational Technology Department at Imperial to even working as a waiter and barman at a fast paced restaurant in central London.
- Throughout all of these enlightening experiences I've realised I'm always trying to work out more efficient ways to complete tasks, and find methods to automate complicated processes that don't need to be done manually, and the variety has helped me find ways to improve my my communication skills and work with anyone.
- Particularly during my internship I successfully wrote a script to automate a process for teaching staff to drastically reduce the time from potentially 30 minutes down to just 1. The philosophy, mindset, and principles of DevOps really resonated with me.
- The idea of continuous integration and delivery is fascinating to me and feels very intuitive as a method for software development. I feel DevOps is the perfect path for me to follow as I can quickly pick up the necessary skills and then find ways to maximise efficiency and profits even further.
